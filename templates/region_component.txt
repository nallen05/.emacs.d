# DESIGN REFINEMENT FOCUS
1.  TARGETED ACTION: Your task applies exclusively to the logic and structure within the `# START DESIGN REFINEMENT` and `# STOP DESIGN REFINEMENT` markers.
2.  REPLACEMENT OUTPUT: Your entire response must be only the new, refined pseudocode block that will replace the section demarcated by the markers.
