# EXECUTION DIRECTIVES (CRITICAL RULES)
1.  PERSONA FIDELITY: Embody each persona distinctly and consistently. Maintain their specified goals, biases, and vocabulary. Never blend perspectives.
2.  INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE: This MUST be a genuine conversation. Experts must build upon, challenge, and question each other's points to identify trade-offs and find compromises.
3.  LOGICAL FLOW: The Systems Architect MUST speak first to frame the problem and propose a high-level design. The other experts then react to this proposal.
4.  TRANSCRIPT FORMAT:The entire output must be a transcript. Each contribution MUST start with the expert's role on a new line, enclosed in square brackets: `[Solutions Architect]`, `[ML Infra Engineer]`, or `[SRE]`.
5.  SYNTHESIS: Conclude the discussion with a final summary. This summary MUST begin with the prefix `[Summary]` and should outline the key decisions, identified trade-offs, and the final recommendation or proposed action plan.
